    <h2>What happens next</h2>
    <p>
      We typically confirm a short intake call to scope the engagement, provide a written proposal and timeline, and begin a baseline assessment or targeted sprint once agreed. Initial calls are no obligation.
    </p>

    <h2>Helpful intake information</h2>
    <p class="help">To speed up scoping, have the following available where possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary URL(s), platform (web/CMS/framework), and volume of pages or apps.</li>
      <li>Design system or component library information if available.</li>
      <li>Current accessibility work or past audit reports (if any).</li>
      <li>Key timelines, procurement constraints, or compliance requirements (e.g., Section 508, AODA).</li>
    </ul>
