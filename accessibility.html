    <p>Digital Design 4 All (DD4A) is committed to digital accessibility and providing equal access to our services. We design and test sites, applications, and documents to conform to recognized accessibility standards.</p>

    <h2>Standards we support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>WCAG 2.2 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)</li>
      <li>EN 301 549 (European accessibility requirements)</li>
      <li>Section 508 (US federal procurement)</li>
      <li>ADA considerations (Titles II and III)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing methodology</h2>
    <p>We use a mixed-methods approach combining automated scans, manual expert review, and assistive-technology testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation). Our reports include test scripts, sampling rationale, and evidence packages to support defensibility.</p>

    <h2>Known limitations</h2>
    <p>Some complex or third-party components may not fully meet all success criteria without vendor cooperation. We document known limitations, mitigation strategies, and recommended next steps in every engagement.</p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you encounter accessibility barriers on this site or in our materials, please <a class="js-email" href="#" data-user="info" data-domain="dd4a.ca">email us</a><noscript> at <span>info [at] dd4a.ca</span></noscript>.</p>
