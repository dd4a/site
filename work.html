    <h2>Selected anonymized case studies</h2>
    <div class="case">
      <h3>Case A — Public sector web service</h3>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> Provincial government digital services portal with high public usage and procurement obligations.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Inconsistent component accessibility, missing keyboard flows, and incomplete documentation causing procurement risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> We performed a baseline audit, compiled an evidence package for procurement review, and delivered a prioritized remediation roadmap.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced regulatory exposure, a clear remediation plan implemented by the in-house team, and a validation report suitable for auditors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case">
      <h3>Case B — Financial services mobile app</h3>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> Large financial institution with mobile-first customers and tight release cadence.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Screen-reader inconsistencies, form validation issues, and accessibility regressions across releases.</p>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> We provided remediation sprints, PR reviews, and established QA acceptance criteria and automated checks.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Faster remediation turnaround, fewer defects in subsequent releases, and reduced high-severity issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case">
      <h3>Case C — International NGO documents program</h3>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> Organization publishing large volumes of reports and outreach PDFs across regions.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Inconsistent document workflows and inaccessible published materials posing reputational and access risks.</p>
