    <h2>1) Accessibility audits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Web applications, websites, mobile apps, PDF documents, and digital content.</li>
      <li><strong>Standards:</strong> WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549, and applicable regulations (ACA, AODA, Section 508).</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Findings with severity, affected users, technical details, and remediation paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Assistive technology testing (screen readers, voice control) and regression QA support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Remediation support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Code-level guidance, design-system pattern fixes, and accessibility refactoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Ticket-ready recommendations, acceptance criteria, and QA protocols your team can execute now.</li>
      <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> We help dev, design, and QA teams understand the &quot;why&quot; so you prevent issues going forward.</li>
      <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Web components, mobile interfaces, and document publishing workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Programs &amp; governance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Accessibility roadmaps, roles, definitions of done, and risk assessment.</li>
      <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> Requirements language for vendors, tools, and third-party services.</li>
      <li><strong>Enablement:</strong> Training and workshops for product, design, dev, QA, and content teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We build systems that scale, not one-off audits.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Quick tip:</strong> If you need compliance, you usually need both:
      (1) a reliable baseline assessment, and (2) ongoing testing to catch regressions.
      We help with both.
