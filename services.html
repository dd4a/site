    <h2>Regulatory context &amp; defensibility</h2>
    <p>
      We structure engagements to support regulatory compliance and defensible decision-making. Our work references applicable standards and laws, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ADA:</strong> Titles II and III considerations for public entities and places of public accommodation.</li>
      <li><strong>Section 508:</strong> US federal procurement and accessibility requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>ACA / AODA:</strong> Canadian provincial and federal accessibility frameworks.</li>
      <li><strong>EN 301 549:</strong> European accessibility standard for public procurement and accessibility claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our audit artifacts, evidence packages, and validation reports are prepared to support legal and procurement review.</p>

    <h2>1) Accessibility audits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Web applications, websites, mobile apps, PDF and Office documents, and digital content workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Standards:</strong> WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549, ADA/Section 508, and regional regulations as requested.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Executive summary for leadership (risk, impact, recommended next steps).</li>
          <li>Detailed technical findings with reproducible test steps, screenshots, assistive technology logs, and severity ratings.</li>
          <li>Evidence package suitable for procurement or legal review (test scripts, timestamps, sampling notes).</li>
          <li>Remediation roadmap with prioritization and estimated effort.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Assistive-technology testing, VPAT / conformance support, and regression QA plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Remediation support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Design-system updates, component-level fixes, front-end remediation, and document remediation workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Ticket-ready remediation tasks with acceptance criteria and code examples.</li>
          <li>Patch reviews, pull-request guidance, and QA test plans.</li>
          <li>Validation reports after remediation with re-test evidence and closure criteria.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Reduced exposure, repeatable QA, and clearer procurement-ready documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Programs &amp; governance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategy &amp; governance:</strong> Accessibility roadmaps, definitions of done, role-based responsibilities, and risk registers.</li>
      <li><strong>Procurement &amp; vendor management:</strong> Accessibility requirements, contract language, and evaluation checklists.</li>
      <li><strong>Training &amp; enablement:</strong> Role-based workshops, reviewer playbooks, and accessibility champions program support.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing validation:</strong> Periodic compliance checks, continuous monitoring plans, and incident-response guidance.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Quick tip:</strong> If you need compliance, you usually need both:
      (1) a reliable baseline assessment, and (2) ongoing testing to catch regressions.
      We help with both.
